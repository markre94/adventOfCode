# Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This repository contains my daily solutions for the programming challenges presented in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of holiday-themed puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. Each challenge sharpens programming, problem-solving, and algorithmic skills.

---

## **Repository Structure**
Each day's solution is stored in its respective folder for better organization and ease of access:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024/
   â”œâ”€â”€ day_01/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
   â”œâ”€â”€ day_02/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
   â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Folder Contents:
- **`solution.py`**: Python script containing the solution to the day's puzzle.
- **`input.txt`**: Puzzle input for that day.
---

## **Usage**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adventOfCode.git
   cd adventOfCode
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder for the specific day:
   ```bash
   cd day_01/
   ```

3. Run the solution script:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

4. If required, update the `input.txt` file with your personal puzzle input.

---

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
- Ensure all necessary libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If specific libraries are used, they will be listed in `requirements.txt`.)*

---

## **Approach**
Each puzzle solution includes:
- **Input Parsing**: Efficiently reading and processing the puzzle input.
- **Logic Implementation**: Applying algorithms or data structures to solve the challenge.
- **Output Generation**: Producing results for both parts of the puzzle (Part 1 and Part 2).

## **Progress**
| Day | Puzzle Name              | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|-----|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| 01  | TBD                      | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| 02  | TBD                      | âœ…     | âœ…     |
| ... | ...                      | ...    | ...    |

Progress will be updated as I solve each day's challenge.
